### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Glad you found your way here :) 

I'm currently helping build Smartwatch by @cult.fit. When I find time, I contribute to open source, you'll find (cool?) stuff I helped build as my pinned repositories 

* Distributed Opossum! : Few hours of unnecessary downtime at work led to an efficient production-ready library for implementing distributed circuit breakers in a microservices architecture


* Transformers by Hugging face: GPTing before it was cool  


* Supervision: They are designing the efficient computer vision ecosystem.


* Personal website: A small internet home I built
